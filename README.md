# Aura

This software is made to be built on the Aura lamp hardware done during our workhsop. 

In order to build it you will have to install two libraries in your arduino environnement.

FastLED : you can install it directly with the library manager of arduino, this library is use to control and manage the LED strip.
Website : http://fastled.io/ 
Documentation : https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Overview

FHT : is used to analyse the music/sound coming from the microphone, you will have to manually download the .zip of the library and install it. You can download it here : http://wiki.openmusiclabs.com/wiki/ArduinoFHT?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=ArduinoFHT2.zip   (V2.0), More information can be found here : http://wiki.openmusiclabs.com/wiki/ArduinoFHT

This project is an Open Source project so feel free to submit your new ideas or to improve the existing code. 

Happy enlightening coding !
